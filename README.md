# Project Title

This Project is developed as part of [PyTorch Scholarship Challenge from Facebook](https://www.udacity.com/facebook-pytorch-scholarship), for the side project
contest.

[Color constancy](https://ipg.fer.hr/ipg/resources/color_constancy?) is the ability of the human visual system that ensures the perception of the color of objects to remain relatively constant under varying illumination conditions. In achieving computational color constancy it is necessary first to estimate the scene illumination and then to perform the chromatic adaptation, which adjusts the scene colors so that they look as they would under a desired illumination (mostly daylight).
